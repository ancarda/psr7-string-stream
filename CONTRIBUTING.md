## Sending Patches

### Via Email

Email is the primary way to send patches to this project. If you are new to
`git send-email`, the website https://git-send-email.io/ has a good intro.
Once you have setup SMTP, you should run this command in the directory where
you checked out this project:

    git config sendemail.to "~ancarda/psr7-string-stream@lists.sr.ht"

You don't need to subscribe to the mailing list to participate.

### Via GitHub

If you are not able or willing to use `git send-email`, you can you can send
patches via GitHub's "Pull Request" feature. The mirror can be forked and is
monitored by the maintainer.

You will need a GitHub account and may need to run non-free JavaScript to send
patches this way.

## Discussions

To discuss features or report bugs, send an email to the mailing list. The
GitHub mirror cannot be used for issue tracking.

Please do not directly submit to the issue tracker.

Discussions that affect _all_ ancarda projects can be sent to the Public Inbox.

And of course, any discussion that is better off-the-record - such as security
reports - can be sent directly to the maintainer. Feel free to use PGP.
